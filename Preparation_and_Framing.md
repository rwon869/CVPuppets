Background and context

The Kinect uses an infrared tracking system that tracks most of the movements of an individual that is in front of it. It utilizes skeletal tracking in order to follow the motion of the user, and is able to track up to two people at the same time. In comparison, OpenCV recognizes the movement that is in front of the camera, however it interprets everything based on positive and negative space. Positive space is relative and is indicated on the screen as the color white, while anything that is negative space shown as black space

Identification
Mitigation
Getting the Kinect to work with OpenCV
Utilizing the openNI package


Tracking the motion through the Kinect and projecting it on the computer
Using the Kinect’s infrared camera to detect movements and create a skeletal tracking
Aligning a two dimensional with the motion
Creating a class that will assign an image on a joint on the skeletal tracking.
